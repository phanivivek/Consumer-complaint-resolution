# Consumer-complaint-resolution

Managing customer complaints is one of the most essential activities of a financial institution. Close to 40% of financial consumers cited complaints management as a key factor in determining the extent to which they trust their financial institution. And failure to manage complaints can result in large penalties.

Complaints management is often reactive rather than proactive. However, if the financial institution is capable to predict this, the more likely the consumer to dispute a conclusion can be provided more attention as to how the complaints are handled as well as how persuasively the ultimate conclusions are conveyed to them. The target over here is to build a prediction model for the column *"Consumer disputed."*
