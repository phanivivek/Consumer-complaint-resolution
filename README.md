# Consumer-complaint-resolution

Managing customer complaints is one of the most important activities for a financial institution. Approximately 40% of financial consumers cited complaints management as a key factor in determining the extent to which they trust their financial institution. And failure to manage complaints can result in large penalties. 


Complaints management is often reactive rather than proactive. However, if we are able to predict this, consumer who is more likely to dispute a conclusion can be given more attention as to how the complaints are handled as well as how persuasively the final conclusions are conveyed to them. Target here is to build prediction model for column *"Consumer disputed"*.
